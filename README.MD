Step to fire this APP:
1. set up a test schema in your mysql local port: 3306, with a username=admin, password=password.
2. import this APP as a maven project.
3. mvn clean install -DSkipTests to compact a war file.
4. run the application with Tomcat. If you are using eclipse or STS, just simply clicking on run on server.
5. insert the mockdata into database. I use MySQL workbench to do so.
6. play around with it to find some bugs.
7. write me an email to talk about more in case you like or hate it.

Thank you for your practice task. Glue my skills together.
